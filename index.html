	<!-- This is a placeholder for the table of vegetables.-->
	<h5> Vegetables on my shopping list. </h5>
	<div id='veggiestable'></div>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let's talk about potatoes. Your average potato is 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. However, there are various types of potatoes. Most potatoes are brown, but some are white and yellow. When you taste potatoes, some are sweet while others are mellow. </p>



	<p> Now let's talk about gym socks. Gym socks are very smelly. So smelly in fact that they make your feet smell bad. actually, I think that it is the other way around. Feet actually imbue the smell into the socks; the socks are not actually the soure of the smell. Did you know that? Go figure! </p>

	<p> Now carrots, those are orange. Did you know that <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/04/carrots-used-to-be-purple-before-the-17th-century/"> (click here) carrots actually used to be purple? </a> Yeah, I didn't know that either. But after I read the article I just linked to, I learned it. Then, I knew it! What an interesting fact. I didn't personally unearth that fact, but I linked to it from another website. I also don't unearth carrots; I buy them at the grocery store. </p>

	<p> In conclusion, vegetables can come in all sorts of colors, shapes and sizes. Our table above gives you an example of several of these, but there are many more. There are many more types of vegetables in many different colors and shapes. It can be fun to explore new varieties of vegetables and keep eating healthy! I hope this has been an interesting read and you have found something intersting during your time here.</p>


	<p> If you're reading this, you've reached the end of the article and probably lost a few brain cells. Now we, a group of professional newspeople, are going to work on improving it. Kind of like a reverse mad-libs. </p>
